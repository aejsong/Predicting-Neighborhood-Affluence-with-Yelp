Since its inception in 2004, the service has amassed 192 million reviews across 4.6 million active local businesses [[source](https://www.yelp-ir.com/overview/default.aspx)].

    "### Issues that arise from the limitations of the free version of Fusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sufficiently wide search query, one could imagine receiving thousands of business listings. However, the free version of Yelp Fusion has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each API request returns a maximum of 50 business listings.\n",
    "    - one can get around this by setting the \"offset\" to 50, 100, etc. to get 51-100, 101-150, etc.\n",
    "- For any given search query, the Fusion API limits its results to 1000.\n",
    "    - Despite this, Yelp will return the total number of businesses that match the given search query (eg 3200) under the \"total\" key. However, collecting listings with an offset of 1000 will result in an error.\n",
    "- Searching by ZIP code will likely result in over 1000 listings in business-dense or very large areas. This means that it would be impossible to get complete results using this method.\n",
    "- Searching by coordinate / radius would be more complete, but given that circles do not pack the same way squares do, we must focus on the most efficient way of arranging circles so that they cover a given area.  \n",
    "    - hexagonal packing seems to be the most straightforward and efficient way to do so.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Our solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "We first sweep across LA county grabbing equally-spaced latitude and longitude coordinates that fall within county lines. At each coordinate, we run a search query; if the query results in up to 1000 listings, we iterate through the `offset` parameter to collect the total amount. In cases where a specific search query will return more than 1000 listings, we split the circle described by the `radius` parameter into 7 smaller, hexagonally arranged circles, and run 7 new searches based on the modified coordinates and radii. If any of these circles still return more than 1000 listings, they are then split into 7 smaller circles, with no limitation to the splitting depth.\n",

    "### `get_businesses()`\n",

    "- `add_businesses()` to add the API response from `call_and_delay()` to a list container.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If total number of listings in the given search area exceeds 1000, then it calls `shotgun()` instead.\n",

    "This function splits a search area into seven smaller search areas with identical radii. Uses:\n",
    "- `get_six_points()`, which repeats `get_earth_radius()` and `get_new_point()` six times:\n",
    "    - since the Earth is not _quite_ spherical, we use ideal oblate spheroid geometry to `get_earth_radius()`. It probably doesn't make a huge difference, but we may as well be thorough.\n",
    "    - given `get_earth_radius()`, we use `get_new_point()` to calculate destination coordinates depending on our starting coordinates, the distance traveled on the surface, and the direction traveled.\n",
    "    - referencing the 7-disk schematic in the above section and using geometry of equilateral triangles, we can calculate that for the shaded circle of radius $r$, each smaller circle has a radius $\\frac{r}{2}$ and the centers of each of the circles are $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$ apart.\n",
    "- `get_businesses()` for each of the seven smaller circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `get_businesses()` and `shotgun()` call each other, this process can be iterated any number of times in order to get the total results at 1000 or below."
